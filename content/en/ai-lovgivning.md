```

### 🎨 Visual Examples

#### Example: Generative AI use
> **📝 Task:** "Write a math task about fractions"

> **🤖 AI-generated answer:**
> ```
> 🔢 Fraction task for 6th grade
> 
> 📝 Task:
> "Emma has 3/4 of a pizza. She eats 1/3 of what she has. 
> How much pizza does she have left?"
> 
> 🧮 Solution:
> 1. Emma has: 3/4 pizza
> 2. She eats: 1/3 of 3/4 = 1/4
> 3. She has left: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
> 
> ✅ Answer: Emma has 1/2 pizza left
> 
> 💡 Explanation:
> • 1/3 of 3/4 = (1×3)/(3×4) = 3/12 = 1/4
> • 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
