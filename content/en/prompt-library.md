## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: AI is a Tool, Not a Shortcut

**Before using these prompts, remember:**
- AI should enhance learning and develop skills, not replace them
- Students must still develop their own knowledge and abilities
- Learn to use modern tools responsibly
- Subject skills should always be the main focus

## What is a Prompt Library?

A prompt library is a collection of pre-tested and optimized prompts (instructions to AI) that give the best results. Instead of starting from scratch each time, you can use these prompts as a starting point and adapt them to your specific needs.

1. **Find** the prompt that matches your need
2. **Copy** the prompt to your AI tool
3. **Adapt** it to your specific situation
4. **Test** and improve the result
5. **Save** your own version for future use
