## üèõÔ∏è Official Guidelines from the Ministry of Education

On June 26, 2025, the [Agency for Education and Quality](https://www.uvm.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/uvm/2025/juni/250626-offentliggoerelse-af-anbefalinger-om-brug-af-generativ-ai-i-undervisningen-i-folkeskolen) published seven recommendations for the use of generative AI in primary education. These recommendations are now the official guidelines for Danish primary schools.

## üéØ The Ministry's Vision

> *"I'm not afraid of smart machines, I'm afraid of stupid people. That's why ChatGPT is not the problem. We shouldn't be machine breakers. Our task is to change both teaching and exams to a reality with artificial intelligence."*
> 
> **- Minister for Children and Education Mattias Tesfaye**

The ministry's approach is that technology can be used as a tool to strengthen students' learning and digital literacy. Students should be helped to become competent and critical users, so they use the new digital tools to qualify their work and avoid the pitfalls that technology also contains.

## üìã The 7 Official Recommendations

### 2. **Use solutions that comply with applicable GDPR rules**
- The municipality is responsible for the General Data Protection Regulation
- Ensure all AI tools comply with GDPR
- Follow the [Agency for IT and Learning's guidance](https://www.stil.dk/vejledninger/vejledning-om-lovlig-brug-af-kunstig-intelligens)

### 5. **Only use generative AI when it provides academic, didactic, and pedagogical meaning**
- Focus on pedagogical and didactic purpose
- Involve students in the discussion
- Vary from subject to subject
- Shift focus from technology to learning

### 6. **Talk to students about how, when, and for what purpose they can use generative AI in individual subjects**

- Shift focus from "cheating" to learning perspective
- Support critical and reflective use

### 7. **Tell parents about the school's approach to generative AI**
